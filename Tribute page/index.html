👉Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist leader who was a key figure in the Indian independence movement against British rule. 
  He was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa, India,to Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati Devi. 
  He came from a well-educated and affluent family,and his father was a lawyer and a prominent leader in the Indian National Congress.
        
👉Bose received his early education at a local school in Cuttack,and later attended Protestant European School in the city.
  He then went on to study at Ravenshaw Collegiate School in Cuttack.
  In 1913, he passed the matriculation examination and in 1915, he passed the Intermediate Examination with a scholarship. 
  In 1916, Bose passed the entrance examination for the University of Calcutta and was admitted to the Presidency College where he studied philosophy.

👉His attempts to get rid of the British with the help of the Nazi party and Imperial Japan during the time of the second world war left him a troubled legacy.
  Although every Indian feels proud by hearing his name, it was not the case during the freedom struggle, 
  especially in the INC where he often faced clashes of ideologies with Gandhiji and he did not get the recognition that he deserved.

👉In honour of his contribution to the freedom struggle recently it was announced that his birthday is celebrated as “PARAKRAM DIWAS” as 
  “parakram” translates to courage in English thereby recognizing his immense contribution by calling his birthday the day of courage.

👉Subhas Chandra Bose joined the Indian National Congress (INC) under the influence of Mahatma Gandhi and started the newspapers called “Swaraj” 
  which means self-governance which marks his entry into politics and his role in the freedom struggle in India has just started. 
  Chittaranjan Das was his mentor.In the year 1923, he became the President of the All India Youth Congress and became the editor of the newspaper “Forward” started by C.R. Das himself. 
  He had also been elected as the mayor of Calcutta back then.He gained leadership spirit and made his way up to the top in the INC very soon. 
  
👉In 1928, the Motilal Nehru Committee demanded Dominion Status in India but Subhash Chandra Bose along with Jawaharlal Nehru asserted that 
  nothing would satisfy other than complete independence of India from the British. 
  Gandhiji strongly opposed the ways of Bose, who wanted independence by hook or by crook, as he was a firm believer of non-violence itself.
  He was sent to jail in 1930 during the Civil Disobedience movement but was related along with other prominent leaders in the year 1931 when the Gandhi-Irwin pact was signed. 
  
👉In 1938, he was elected as President at the Haripura session of the INC and re-elected at the Tripuri Session in 1939 by competing against Dr P. Sitaramayya who was supported by Gandhi himself.
  He maintained strict standards during the commencement of the first World War and demanded full independence of India from the British within six months. 
  He faced vehement objections from inside the Congress which led him to resign from INC and form a more progressive group called the “Forward Bloc”. 
  
👉He started a mass movement against using Indian men in the wars of foreign countries which received immense support 
  and voice which led him to be put under house arrest in Calcutta but he left the house in disguise in January 1941 
  and reached Germany via Afghanistan and met the Nazi leader there to seek help from them to drive the British away from India. 
  He also sought help from Japan. He made full use of the philosophy “an enemy's enemy is a friend”.
